Class: FCS1
Team: 2

## Overview 🧐

Welcome to FireWatch, a SC1015 Mini Project dedicated to the detection of fires through image analysis. By harnessing the power of cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning technologies, FireWatch is designed to swiftly identify the presence of fire in images captured by cameras or sensors. Our mission is to provide a reliable and efficient solution for early fire detection, ultimately contributing to enhanced safety and protection against wildfires.

## Objectives 🎯

- Employ advanced image processing techniques to enhance image quality and extract pertinent features.
- Implement state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to classify images based on the presence of fire.
- Evaluate and optimize the performance of the fire detection model to ensure reliability and efficiency.

### 1. [Problem Formulation] (https://google.com.sg)
**Dataset Used:** [FIRE Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phylake1337/fire-dataset)
**Question:** Would it be possible to achieve early detection of fire? 🤔

**Success:** Determined using blobs formed by CV2 \
**Exceptions:** Outliers/Anomalies found in blobbing images with intense lighting or color mixtures closely resembling brown 🚨🔍

**Rationale:** Our team firmly believes that both the dataset and question we are exploring hold significant relevance in the global context. As students of SCSE, the development of a fire detection model holds immense potential in providing early warnings to individuals within the vicinity, ultimately facilitating prompt action to isolate and mitigate fires.
